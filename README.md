Currently configured for Vanilla+ PvP (WSG/AB/AC and all arena brackets) 

Bot token removed for security reasons doi.

Should probably clean up the config/default into a single file. Lazy.

Requires node/npm and discord.js package. 

OAUTH2 - Iforgetlol (964220516416 in drafting notes for 'permission bitmask' but idk, if you use it probably check dev portal and make sure you have enough permissions or just set manually on server role after invite)

Bot Intent - Requires 'Message Content'
